# About Igniter
Igniter is a Rails application template, based on the Kickoff template by Andy Leverenz. It's however, more opinionated and includes the following:

* Almost everything that is present in the Kickoff template: devise auth, friendly_id, sidekiq, foreman and webpacker.
* Devise omniauth login.
* The possibility to choose which CSS framework you wish to work with.
* File upload gems and configuration using the Shrine gem in combination with the s3-sdk and fast_image and image_processing.
* Testing with RSpec out of the box, including some very basic user tests.
* More features comingâ€¦
